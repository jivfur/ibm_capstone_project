# IBM Capstone Project

## Summary of methodologies:

The project started with collecting and cleaning public data from SpaceX and Wikipedia by API and Web scrapping respectively. After replacing the missing data with the average of each feature and exploratory analysis was performed. A Dashboard is provided to analyze the data in real time. Four Models were training to find if the mission will succeed or not. In this project Success means if the mission landed. To select the best model Cross Validation was performed in all the models.

## Summary of all results:

The best model was the KNN with 94 % of accuracy to determine if the mission will succeed or not. The Confusion Matrix shows that the model did not have False Positive.  It has only one False Negative.
